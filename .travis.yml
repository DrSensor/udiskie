# This means that binary distributions can be used for the dependencies.
# Travis runs on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS currently. :(
python:
  # - "2.5"
  # - "2.6"
  - "2.7"
  - "3.2"

# Install dependencies that are hard to install:
# (these can't be built via setuptools)
before_install:
  - sudo apt-get -qy update
  - sudo apt-get -qy install python-gobject python3-gobject

# Setup (performed within virtualenv)
install:
  # Check that package can be installed from source distribution:
  - python setup.py sdist
  - pip install $(ls ./dist/*.tar.gz | sort -rV | head -n1)
