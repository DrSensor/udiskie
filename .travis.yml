# NOTE: Travis currently runs tests on Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) whose native
# python3 distribution is py34. This means that we do not have access to
# adequate system packages for use with `--system-site-packages`:
#   - python-gobject
#   - python3-gi

# Inherit system site packages for use in virtualenv:
# virtualenv:
#   system_site_packages: true

# Setup (performed within virtualenv)
install:
  # Check that package can be installed from source distribution:
  - pip install keyutils
  - python setup.py sdist
  - pip install $(ls ./dist/*.tar.gz | sort -rV | head -n1)

# Actual tests:
